# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This command-line application allows the user to make a simple SVG logo. By entering up to 3 characters, a text color, picking a shape (triangle, circle, square), and a shape color, a logo.svg file is created. This provides the user with a simple file to use for their logo. Since the only thing that the user has to do is answer a few simple prompts, it couldn't be easier.
